            <p>
                Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common 
                and serious medical illness that negatively affects 
                how you feel, the way you think and how you act. 
                Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes 
                feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities 
                you once enjoyed.       
            </p>
